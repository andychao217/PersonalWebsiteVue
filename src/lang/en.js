They have no respect of status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do, is ignore them, because they change things. They push human race forward. Some may see them as the crazy ones. We see genius，because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world....are the ones who do.",
